            <li>Thickish cut steak</li>
            <li>Butter</li>

            <li>Thyme</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steak cooking tips</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring to room temp! This makes an amazing difference to cooking through evenly rather than ending up with a thick overcooked band in order for the very centre to be cooked to your liking;</li>
            <li>Pat dry and season the steak generously with salt and pepper, this helps form that amazing crust we all know and love about great steaks;</li>
            <li>Get your skillet SMOKING HOT before putting the steak in, again, for the crust</li>
            <li>WARNING: The butter will sputter when you add the thyme, so stand back!</li>
            <li>Take the steak off the stove BEFORE your desired internal temperature because the intgoernal temperature will continue to rise as it rests; and</li>
            <li>REST your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in and the fibres relax. This is a must-do step for any protein you cook hard and fast!</li>
        </ol>
